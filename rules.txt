This program shuffle cards randomly at the beginning of the game. If you keep losing, you are very unlucky! Each card has a value, with 2 to 10 hold a value of their number, while J, Q, and K cards hold a value of 10. Ace cards hold a value of 11. The goal of this game is to reach a card value total of 21. After the dealing of the first two cards, you must decide whether to HIT or STAnd. Stand will keep you safe, hit will add another card. As you are competing against the dealer, you must beat his hand. However, if your total goes over 21, you will LOSE! Just remember not to get bankrupt!!
